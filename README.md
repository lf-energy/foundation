# LF Energy Governance documents

This is a testbed for developing governance documents, updated February 2020. We are following LF best practices & templates with guidance from successful existing projects like CNCF.

In short, ideas become projects in a more or less linear fashion. Later stages include more direct support from LF Energy.

<b>idea</b> → <b>discussion</b> → <b>SIG or workgroup</b> → <b>Incubation stage</b> → <b>Early Adoption stage</b> → <b>Graduated stage</b> → <b>Emeritus stage</b>

Guide to these documents:

* [current-projects.md](current-projects.md) - basic information and links for current LF Energy projects
