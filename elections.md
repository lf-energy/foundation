## Nominations

Nominations are done via email. Members of the electorate group may nominate someone else in the electorate group or self-nominate. All nominations must include the nomineeâ€™s name, company affiliation, and a short background on the nominee and why they wish to serve in the role. All nominations are confirmed before the election.


## Elections

If there are the same number or fewer of nominees for the given role as there are persons to be elected, those nominees are automatically elected. The electorate will be informed of this via email.

An election will be held if there are more nominees for the given role than the number of persons elected. LF Energy uses [OpaVote](https://opavote.com) for the election process. Electorates will be sent an email with the complete list of nominees to review and a separate email from OpaVote with a unique link to submit their ballot. Voting will be done using the checkbox method; electors will checkbox the individual(s) they wish to elect.

Election results will be announced to the electorate and relevant committee the day after the election closes.

If you have any questions about the election process, please contact the [LF Energy staff](https://members.lfenergy.org).
