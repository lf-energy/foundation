Per the LF Energy Standards and Specification (LFESS) membership agreement, section (2) specifies that “Steering Members shall be appointed by the LF Energy Governing Board.”

This document defines the process and policy for appointing LFESS Steering Members.

## LF Energy Strategic Members

Every LF Energy Strategic Member in Good Standing shall be entitled to become an LFESS Steering Member, provided they execute the LFESS Membership agreement prior to serving on the LFESS Steering Committee. The term of their LFESS Steering Membership ends upon no longer being an LF Energy Strategic Member in Good Standing.

## Additional Steering Members

The LF Energy General Members in Good Standing that are also LFESS General Members in Good Standing shall elect annually an LF Energy General Member in Good Standing that is also a General Member of LFESS to be an LFESS Steering Member for each 10 LF Energy General Members in Good Standing who are also LFESS General Members, with at least one (1) and no more than (3) three elected LF Energy General Member in Good Standing that are also a General Member of LFESS. The LF Energy elected General Member shall appoint the representative that will serve on the LFESS Steering Committee. The term of their LFESS Steering Membership will be one (1) year from the date of their appointment or until the LFE General Membership is no longer in Good Standing, or removal by the LF Energy Governing Board, whichever comes first.

This policy will be made public and published on the website of the LF Energy Foundation.
